# Tokyo Hackerspace Laser Cutter

This repository is meant to contain the collective knowledge about using the laser cutter.  To use the laser cutter please download Laser Web (version 4) from the Laser Web wiki  https://github.com/LaserWeb/LaserWeb4/wiki

## Laser Web Configs
Configuration files for laser web are located in the laser-web-configs directory of this repository.  Instructions coming at a later date.  For now know that using these will setup laser web with the settings you need.

## Smoothie Controller
This directory contains the current firmware binary file and the current config.txt file that are installed on the Smoothie Board.  You should not need to worry about these unless you are doing an update to the laser cutter.  If you are please make sure to copy any changes back to the git repository, commit it and tag it as the next major version.
